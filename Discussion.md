Theory of mind is the ability to assign distinct mental states (beliefs, intents, knowledge,â€¦) to other members. In this project, we aim to teach agents via reinforcement learning to solve a perspective-taking task that requires the agent to consider the perceptual state of another.

Partial information decomposition: estimating who knows what in complex sytems:
Mutual information quantifies the amount of information shared by two random variables. Such measure has been extensively applied to quantify information flowing in natural and man-made communication channels. However, it has been argued that an information theoretic description of computation (as opposed to simply communication) requires to quantify the distribution of information that a set of input variables has about an output variable. In particular, such information could be provided individually (unique), redundantly (shared), or exclusively jointly (synergetic). The partial information decomposition (PID) is an axiomatic framework to define such information distributions. In this project together with the group of Dirk Oliver Theis, we are developing a numerical estimator of PID and applying it to understand how information is distributed across parts of different complex systems.    

IDEA: could we use PID ideas to drive intrinsic motivation-based RL with multiagents?
