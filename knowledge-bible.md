In \cite{Yosinski14Understanding}\cite{JAIR17IReviewed} they study the transferability of features for the purpose of ne tuning. In that regard, authors nd that the distance between the source and target tasks is strongly related with the depth of the optimal layer to use for the transfer learning process.authors empirically evaluate several parameters that can aect . ->Daniela's idea of adapting learning process and rewards according to one of the 7 plots of movies and one of the x plots of tasks existing when learning.  Can we find a depth of network automatically or learning curriculum, i.e., syllabus for each of the tasks before teaching a robot to do it?
