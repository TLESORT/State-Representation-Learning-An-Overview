# DEEP LEARNING IN ROBOTICS IS COMING  !!!!

## Abstract

Deep learning in robotics is coming. Very soon robot will be able to benefit from the deep learning framework to make complex choices and predictions in a robust and automous fashon. The interesting particularity of a robot is that it's input are , as a human, multimodale. The robot can use it's camera at the same time than a lidar, a radar, a microphone or all the tools you can imagine. For deep learning here come the classic problem of the curse of dimensionality. How to make an algortihm able to make prediction with several high dimension inputs and how make it find hidden dependencies between them online ? The solution is reduce the dimensionality by learning state representation. State representation learning means find the few hidden parameters of each of the input (or modularity). Once the hidden parameters are found the task of finding dependencies between modularities is no more bothered by the dimensionality. This paper aims to cover the state of the art about state representation learning. It presents the different methods used to disentangle the hidden parameters of an datasets and to validate the learned state representation. This overview is particularely focus on learning representation in low dimensionnality (<5) of known parameters like the state of an 3D object. This scope make it possible to assess the representation learned.

## Scope of the paper (I am still no sure about this)

This paper speak about learning low dimension representation easely interpretable which can be assess thanks to a ground truth. The groundtruth should nethertheless not be use for learning the representation. <br>
The representation can be task specific.<br>

### No reward learning
Once a loss on reward is defined, in end-to-end RL systems, the representation is delegated to backpropagation without further attention to other supervisory signals. Representation learning can thus be considered a bottleneck in current approaches bound by reward \cite{Shelhamer17}.  Next we describe some approaches in this line:

End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) addresses representation learning at the same time as policy optimization, where current efforts tackle this problem normally from the point of view of stochastic optimization and exploration.

* A new embedding quality assessment method for manifold learning, Zhang11. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.1636v1.pdf we have their matlab code
Interesting paper about evaluating embeddings through Normalization independent embedding quality (NIEAQA) ssessment, a normalization independent embedding quality criterion, for manifold learning purposes, based on the anisotropic scaling independent measure (ASIM), which compares the similarity between two configurations under motion and anisotropic coordinate scaling. NIEQA is based on ASIM, and consists of three assessments, a local one, a global one and a linear combination of the two. The local measure evaluates how well local neighborhood information is preserved under anisotropic coordinate scaling and rigid motion. NIEQA is valued between 0 and 1, where 0 represents a perfect preservation and its highlights is is the ability of being applicable to both normalized and isometric embeddings, it can provide both local and global assessments, and it can serve as a natural evaluation tool of learned embeddings \cite{Gracia14}.

### Interpretability  methods for evaluating learned representations

[Assessment problematique]

The objective of WHAT? assessment?** is to give a quantitative value which estimates the quality of a representation. In the context of representation learning this can be harder than expected. The assessment should show if the representaiotn we learned is conform to what we expect.<br>
Do we expect something in particular?<br>
What can we assume other that the information hold by the representation? <- the neighborhood!<br>
and then what tool can we use?<br>
What learning method make us able to make stronger result assumption?<br><br>
Still thinking about it.....<br>

### Qualitative method

### Quantitative method (METRICS)
Particular metrics of interest to assess quality of prediction go beyond the \textit{blurry} MSE (Mean Squared Error) loss function. Complementary feature learning strategies include multi-scale architectures, adversarial training methods, and image gradient difference loss functions as proposed in \cite{Mathieu15}. More concretely,  the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index Measure and image sharpness show to be better proxies for next frame prediction assessment \cite{Mathieu15}.

Basic idea: The loss is based on prediction errors of next states.

* Deep multi-scale video prediction beyond mean square error, Mathieu15. Video Prediction can be done with more robust measures than MSE. In \cite{Mathieu15}, they propose several strategies for next frame prediction evaluation assessing the quality of the prediction in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index Measure and image sharpness.  
IDEA: can be extended to be combined with optical flow prediction  and replace optical flow prediction algorithms with next frame prediciotion.
