# Autoencoders

If we assume that the underltying states we want to learnn are sufficient to a good reconstruction of the input, we can force a neural network to encode a state into a determinated dimension which make it possible to reproduce the complete input. This approach is implemented by autoencoders. We force a neural network to have same input and ouput with a botleneck into the structure. After training the autoencoders the botleneck values for a given input is espected to be the state learned. This part present the different kind of autoencoders used to achieved state representation learning, how they have been trained and implemented.
