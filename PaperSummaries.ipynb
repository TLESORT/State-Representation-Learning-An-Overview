Relational reasoning is very closely linked to the elusive human \"common sense\", something that for a long time we thought not even other animals could do (eg \"what is the color of the object closest to the red square?\" \"How many objects have the same shape as the blue one?\"). Now this system achieves higher accuracy than humans.  [1706.01427] A simple neural network module for relational reasoning."
